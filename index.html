            <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>

            <p>
                The dataset used in this project comes from the
                <strong>UCI Machine Learning Repository</strong> and is titled
                <em>Student Performance</em> (Cortez, 2008). It contains academic and
                demographic information for secondary school students from two
                Portuguese schools: Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>What the Data Captures</h3>
            <p>
                Each observation in the dataset represents one student. The dataset
                includes academic performance measures such as first, second, and final
                period grades (G1, G2, G3), as well as behavioral and contextual variables
                including number of absences, study time, health status, family background,
                parental occupation, and extracurricular participation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final grade (G3), measured on a 0–20 scale, is the outcome variable of the analisis. Additional variables such as absences,
                study time, parental job, and health provide insight into factors that
                may influence academic performance.
            </p>

            <h3>Potential Biases and Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limited geographic scope:</strong> The dataset includes only
                    two schools in Portugal, which limits generalizability to other regions
                    or education systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Self-reported measures:</strong> Variables such as health and
                    study time are based on student reporting and may contain inaccuracies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cross-sectional data:</strong> The dataset captures a single
                    academic year, making it difficult to infer long-term trends or causal
                    relationships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cultural context:</strong> Educational norms and family structures
                    in Portugal may differ from those in other countries.

                This analysis focuses on two quantitative variables

                two ordinal variables (<strong>Study Time</strong> and
                <strong>Family Relationship</strong>), and two nominal variables

                <p>
                    The average number of absences is <strong>3.66</strong>, with a
                    relatively large standard deviation of <strong>4.64</strong>.
                    This suggests that while many students miss only a few classes,
                    some students have substantially higher absence counts, increasing
                    variability in attendance.
                    The average final grade (G3) is <strong>11.91</strong> on a 0–20 scale,
                    with a standard deviation of <strong>3.23</strong>. This indicates
                    moderate overall academic performance with noticeable variation
                    among students.

                    Most students fall into the lower study time categories (1 and 2),

            <h2>Frequency/Distribution Visualizations</h2>

            <h3>Distribution of Absences</h3>
            <img src="images/Distribution-of-Absences.png" alt="Distribution of absences">
            <p>
                The distribution of absences is strongly right-skewed. Most students have
                relatively few absences, with the highest frequency near zero to five
                absences. However, a small number of students exhibit very high absence
                counts, extending beyond 20 and even 30 absences. This skewness suggests
                that extreme absenteeism may play a significant role in academic outcomes.
            </p>

            <h3>Distribution of Final Grades</h3>
            <img src="images/Distribution-Final-Grade.png" alt="Distribution of final grades">
            <p>
                Final grades appear approximately bell-shaped, centered around 11–13
                on a 0–20 scale. While most students cluster around the middle of the
                grading range, there are relatively few extremely low or extremely high
                scores. This moderate spread suggests variability in performance but no
                extreme polarization.
            </p>

            <h3>Distribution of Study Time</h3>
            <img src="images/Distribution-of-StudyTime.png" alt="Distribution of study time">
            <p>
                Most students fall into the lower study time categories (levels 1 and 2),
                representing fewer than five hours of weekly study time. Far fewer students
                report studying more than 10 hours per week (level 4). This imbalance
                suggests that high study effort is less common, which may influence grade variation.
            </p>

            <h3>Distribution of Family Relationship</h3>
            <img src="images/Distribution-Family-Relationship.png" alt="Distribution of Family Relationship Quality">
            <p>Family relationship quality is concentrated in the higher categories
                (levels 4 and 5). Very few students report poor family relationships
                (levels 1 or 2). This indicates that most students perceive strong family
                support, though the smaller lower-quality groups may still show differences
                in academic outcomes.
            </p>

            <h3>Distribution of Reason for Attendance</h3>
            <img src="images/Distribution-of-Reason-for-attendence.png" alt="Distribution of reason for attendance">
            <p>
                The most common reason for attending school is categorized as "Other,"
                followed by course preference and school reputation. Fewer students
                selected proximity to home. These differences may reflect varying levels
                of academic motivation or institutional preference.
            </p>

            <h3>Distribution of School</h3>
            <img src="images/Distribution-of-Schools.png" alt="Distribution of schools">
            <p>
                The dataset contains more students from Gabriel Pereira (GP) than
                Mousinho da Silveira (MS). While this imbalance does not affect
                descriptive analysis, it is important to consider when comparing
                academic performance across institutions.

            <img src="images/FinalGradevsNumberofAbsences.png" alt="Absences vs final grade">
            <p>
                The scatterplot shows a slight negative trend between absences and
                final grade (G3). As absences increase, final grades tend to decrease.
                The regression line slopes downward, suggesting a negative association
                between attendance and performance. While the relationship is not extremely strong, students with very
                high absence counts appear more likely to receive lower grades.
                This pattern suggests attendance may influence academic outcomes.

            <p>
                The boxplot comparing final grades across study time levels shows
                an upward shift in median grades as study time increases. Students
                in higher study time categories generally have higher median G3 scores.

            <h3>G3 by Family Relationship</h3>

            <p>
                The boxplot of final grade by family relationship quality shows
                a modest increase in median grades as reported family relationship
                quality improves. Students reporting higher levels (4 and 5)
                tend to have slightly higher median G3 scores. Therefore, the more familial support a student has the likelier they will perform better academically

            <h3>Hypothesis 1</h3>
            <p>Students with higher numbers of absences will have significantly
                lower final grades (G3) than students with fewer absences.</p>

            <h3>Hypothesis 2</h3>
            <p>Students who report higher weekly study time will have higher
                average final grades (G3) than students with lower study time levels.</p>

            <h3>Hypothesis 3</h3>
            <p>Students reporting higher family relationship quality will have
                higher average final grades (G3) compared to students reporting
                lower relationship quality.</p>
